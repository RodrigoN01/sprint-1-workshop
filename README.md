# Reflection - Sprint 1

## Command Line

This was the first topic of our course at Dev Academy.

The command line is a tool or software where you can interact with you computer in a similar way you would on your file explorer or "finder", however on the command line, instead of clicking and dragging your files and directories, you write commands to interact with them.

In each section of the course they provide a timebox, where they suggest the amount of time to complete each section. In this particular case I didn't stick to the time box because I've decided to customize my command line a bit more, using iTerm2 and Oh My Zsh!, both tools has its own particular features, such as themes, autocomplete, show brach and directories in a much more fun way.

I've learnt a variety of commands, such as:

- mkdir = create or make a directory
- touch = create a file
- ls = list the files and directories in a directory
- rm -r = remove a directory
- cd = change directory

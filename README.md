# Reflection - Sprint 1

## Command Line

This was the first topic of our course at Dev Academy.

The command line is a tool or software where you can interact with you computer in a similar way you would on your file explorer or "finder", however on the command line, instead of clicking and dragging your files and directories, you write commands to interact with them.

On each section of the course they provide a timebox, where they suggest the amount of time you need to complete each section. In this particular case I didn't stick to the time box because I've decided to customize my command line a bit more, using iTerm2 and Oh My Zsh!, both tools have its own particular features, such as themes, autocomplete, show brach and directories in a much more fun way.

I've learnt a variety of commands, such as:

- mkdir = create or make a directory
- touch = create a file
- ls = list the files and directories in a directory
- rm -r = remove a directory
- cd = change directory

## Version Control with Git

In this section we've leant about git and Github.

These two are very distinctive from each other. Git is a Version Control software where you have the ability have multiple people working on the same project allowing them to contribute in a very organized way without overwriting each other. And Github is where you'd be publishing your projects, either privately or publicly, where your team can see the changes and version of your project.

Since I was very familiar with this topic from previous studies, I don't think I will be revisiting this material to understand the difference between git and Github.

This time I stuck with the timebox, I was slightly faster because I was familiar with the topic.
